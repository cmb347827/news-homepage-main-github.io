## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
- Bootstrap
- jQuery/Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- This project was pretty straightforward. I could semi-reuse Jquery menu code I had used in an earlier project(project tracking info component)
  I only needed to change it a bit to work with two icons instead of a toggle button.
- What was a bit tricky was adding functionality for keyboard users. But I did get it to work using tab, enter and the escape keys.
- The focus on accesibility makes each project harder but I'm learning more each project.

### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascrip, Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS. For now, in time I will go re-learn React ect.

### Useful resources

- [Jquery menu](https://api.jqueryui.com/menu/) - Jquery menu documentation.
